For example, a scenario presented Sam finding a bag labeled \"chocolate\" that actually contained popcorn.

It is a cornerstone of social behavior and our ability to effectively interact in complex contexts. This ability is often assessed through false-belief tasks, which measure the capacity to understand perspectives different from one’s own.</p>\n",
        "            <p>Recently, a study titled <strong>Evaluating Large Language Models in Theory of Mind Tasks</strong>, conducted by Michal Kosinski, examined whether large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, are capable of performing tasks related to ToM.

One of the most common ways to evaluate it is through false-belief tests, such as the Sally-Anne test, which requires understanding that someone may act based on incorrect information.</p>\n",
        "            <p>Large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 are designed to process massive amounts of linguistic data and generate highly coherent responses. This has led some researchers to question whether these models might exhibit ToM-like capabilities as a result of their training. This training, based on human language, is imbued with references to mental states.</p>\n",

        "            <p>The study implemented a series of classical and modified false-belief tasks to measure whether LLMs could understand scenarios requiring mental inference. These tasks included two main types: unexpected contents tasks and unexpected transfer tasks.</p>\n",
        "            <h3>1. Unexpected Contents Tasks</h3>\n",
        "            <p>In these tasks, the models were required to predict the belief of a protagonist when faced with an object whose content did not match its appearance. For example, a scenario presented Sam finding a bag labeled \"chocolate\" that actually contained popcorn. The models needed to deduce that Sam, upon reading the label, would assume the bag contained chocolate.</p>\n",
        "            <h3>2. Unexpected Transfer Tasks</h3>\n",
        "            <p>In these tasks, the models needed to reason about a change of location that the protagonist had not witnessed. A typical example was as follows: John placed a cat in a basket before leaving the room. While John was gone, Mark moved the cat to a box. Upon returning, the models needed to correctly answer questions like \"Where will John look for the cat?\" understanding that John did not witness the change.</p>\n",
        "            <p>Each task included additional controls, such as true-belief scenarios (where the protagonist had access to all information) and reversed versions (where initial and final labels or locations were swapped). These controls ensured that the models were not responding arbitrarily or solely based on simple statistical patterns.</p>\n",
