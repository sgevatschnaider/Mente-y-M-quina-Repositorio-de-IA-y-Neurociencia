# Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience: Exploring the Mind and the Machine

This repository lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Neuroscience**, two fields that share fundamental approaches and synergies. Here, we explore theories, simulations, and practical applications to understand how neuroscientific principles inspire advanced algorithms and how AI can provide new perspectives on studying the human brain.

<h2>Theory of Mind</h2>

<p>
Theory of Mind refers to the ability to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions different from one's own. This concept is key in neuroscience and is applied to simulate cognitive processes in artificial intelligence.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to explore key topics at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Neuroscience**:

1. Biologically inspired models: Neural networks based on neuroscientific theories.
2. AI as a tool for neuroscience: Analysis of neuroimaging and neural signals.
3. Simulation of neuroscientific principles: Computational implementation of theories such as **Theory of Mind** and the **Free Energy Principle**.
4. Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI): Development of brain-computer interfaces.

Additionally, this repository includes practical implementations, interactive notebooks, and detailed documentation.
